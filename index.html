    <h1>You should eat some tasty chicken</h1>
    <p>First of all Jake paul is da boi, even though he flexes alot. Second of all Tacos are pretty lit. Tacos are better than jake paul and Logan paul because they are better for the community. For example Tacos can be made with many differnt foods unlike jake paul and Logan Paul( They are not food).Also Jake and Logan paul cant have different foods inside of their tortillas, because they dont have them. Or maybe they do but it's probably their skin. Plz dont hate on Jake Pul or Logan  Paul, its just that I believe that taco's are more important than the paul's.</p>
